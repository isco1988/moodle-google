Moodle-GoogleApps Integration

Moodlerooms and Google have worked together to build a state of the art integration. The 1.0 version of the integration provides:

1. Moodle users are automatically created in Google Apps (Google Docs, Calendar, and Gmail).

2. When you log in to Moodle, you are automatically logged in to Google Apps.

3. A Gmail block in Moodle displays your latest Gmail messages when you login to the Moodle Front Page.

4. A Google Apps block on the Moodle Front Page displays links to your Google Start Page, Google Docs, Google Calendar and Gmail.

5. A Google Widget shows a link to Moodle on the Google side.
